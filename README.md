# Saudi-English Sentiment Analysis Code-Switching Dataset (SESA-CSD)
This dataset was constructed from Ar-En
Code-Switching Textual Dataset (ArE-CSTD) (Al-
harbi et al., 2024). The original data was derived by the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence at the Saudi Data and Ar-
tificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA). It is syn-
thetic data generated by GPT-4 and contains three
different versions of code-switching texts: Mod-
ern Standard Arabic with English, Egyptian di-
alect with English, and Saudi dialect with En-
glish. We constructed a 1k-sample dataset from
the Saudi-English version and annotated it with
three sentiment labels: positive, negative, and
neutral. The newly constructed dataset, referred
to as Saudi-English Sentiment Analysis Code-
Switching Dataset (SESA-CSD), constitutes the
first resource for sentiment analysis of Saudi-
English code-switching texts. More details about the dataset can be found in the paper.
