# Saudi-English Sentiment Analysis Code-Switching Dataset (SESA-CSD)
This dataset was constructed from the [Ar-En Code-Switching Textual Dataset (ArE-CSTD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sdaiancai/arabic-english-code-switching-textual-dataset) , which is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. The data was developed by the National Centre for Artificial Intelligence at the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA).It is synthetic data generated by GPT-4 and contains three different versions of code-switching texts: Modern Standard Arabic with English, Egyptian dialect with English, and Saudi dialect with English. We constructed a 1k-sample dataset from
the Saudi-English version and annotated it with three sentiment labels: positive, negative, and neutral. The newly constructed dataset, referred
to as Saudi-English Sentiment Analysis Code-Switching Dataset (SESA-CSD), constitutes the first resource for sentiment analysis of Saudi-English code-switching texts. More details about the dataset can be found in the paper.
